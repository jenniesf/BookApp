# Bookworm

Bookworm is a user-friendly book management app. Users can create their own account, have access to a massive database of books, and search books by title, author, ISBN, or subject.
Users can create a reading list bookshelf, track their reading progress, and write and share reviews.

The feed feature allows users to discover reviews created by other users. 
The bookmark feature allows users to track reading progress and page number for multiple books at a time.
The bookshelf feature helps users organize their reading list and reading goals by making it more likely that they'll read everything on their list.
